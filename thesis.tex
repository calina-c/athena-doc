\chapter{Bibliographic research}

Although the ATHENA application itself is original work, it is common practice to reuse validated approaches and combine well-known algorithms to achieve a goal such ambitious as this one, i.e. to provide social media analytics capabilities in a familiar, web-based application, to non-expert users. A number of approaches related to this field are in existence, with some having overall structural similarities (e.g. pipeline approaches or web-based applications), while others being proven solutions for just part of the ATHENA pipeline (e.g. K-Means clustering, Power law fitting etc.).

\section{Social media analytics}
Social media analytics has received much attention in recent years. Since the explosion of social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and others, the number of sentiment-loaded posts authored by individual users has increased exponentially. This raises the problem of filtering out useless data and noise, and compiling the large number of posts into useful, concentrated information snippets social media marketers can use for advertising and barter choice purposes.

\section{In-house social media}
Exploiting on the trend for social media data mining, some social networks have created their own analysis tools. Much of these are internal, but examples such as Facebook's Graph Search, which is free to use by application developers and individual users, are great tools for analytics purposes. Approaches such as the 2014 study \cite{spirin2014people} found that using Facebook Graph Search can facilitate people search along demographics and profiles.

Besides in-house tools, social media networks provide APIs for developers interested in researching user behaviour, brand popularity etc. Examples include Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Foursquare, Meetup, Slack, Flickr and Google Plus\footnote{http://www.programmableweb.com/news/top-10-social-apis-facebook-twitter-and-google-plus/analysis/2015/02/17}. Web mining approaches such as \cite{java2007we} try to understand virtual social communities by using these APIs. This latter study uses Twitter API. It is not surprising that the reusability of certain API queries were exploited in numerous API wrappers, in different programming languages\footnote{https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/twitter-libraries}.

\subsection{Social media analytics in companies}
Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems appeared in the 1990s as a counter wave to company siloing. The phenomenon is described as the specialisation and lack of streamlined cooperation between company departments. Marketing is one such department, in which operations should take into account results and goals from other departments and external sources combined. Unfortunately, since the social media explosion took place in recent years only, and ERP systems are generally large-scale and quite resistant to change, it is yet not implemented that social media data mining tools are well-integrated in ERPs. This is in spite of the clear connection between social media and Web 2.0 concepts to retailing power, as proven by numerous studies \cite{constantinides2008social}.

\section{Structurally-similar works}
The following section presents the advantages and drawbacks of using meta-frameworks such as approaches to application development and natural language processing.

\subsection{Advantages of web applications}
Web applications enjoy a high popularity since it is not necessary to install any software on computers in order to run such applications. Almost all modern computer users use web browsers, and so the execution intermediary is already installed in most cases. Ease of usage without downloading anything, availability of updates and patches without any distribution chain necessary and other advantages as mentioned in \cite{tung2013internet} suggest the appropriateness of developing such an application as a web one. Another important advantage is the fact that in case users develop a need to run this application from mobile devices, a REST architecture to expose the modules would suffice.

Since web application frameworks are ubiquitous these days, it is also the case that a scientifically-rich Python application can easily be integrated to a web application using one of Python's frameworks such as Django, Flask or CherryPy. Indeed the number of wrappers and tools available in Python's scientific libraries have prompted researchers to make various natural language processing applications in this language. The 2009 book "Natural language processing with Python" \cite{bird2009natural} encourages developers to use Python as a programming language most suitable for text processing, complete with support from external libraries such as NLTK (Natural Language ToolKit), Sci-Kit Learn (for machine learning), SciPy, Numpy, matplotlib and so on.

We conclude that the prevalence of the Python recommendation in literature is significant in making a decision related to the project's development. Based on numerous similar approaches, ATHENA also employs Python and its web application components in creating an easy to use and relevant social media analysis tool.

The purpose of this chapter is to explain the operating principles of the implemented application.
Here you write about your solution from a theory standpoint - i.e. you explain it and you demonstrate its theoretical properties/value, e.g.:
\begin{itemize}
 \item used or proposed algorithms
 \item used protocols
 \item abstract models
 \item logic explanations/arguments concerning the chosen solution
 \item logic and functional structure of the application, etc.
\end{itemize}

{\color{red} YOU DO NOT write about implementation.

YOU DO NOT copy/paste info on technologies from various sources and others alike, which do not pertain to your project.

\chapter{User's manual}

In the installation description section your should detail the hardware and software resources needed for installing and running the application, and a step by step description of how your application can be deployed/installed. An administrator should be able to perform the installation/deployment based on your instructions.

In the user manual section you describe how to use the application from the point of view of a user with no inside technical information; this should be done with screen shots and a stepwise explanation of the interaction. Based on user's manual, a person should be able to use your product.
