\chapter{Bibliographic research}


Bibliographic research has as an objective the establishment of the references for the project, within the project domain/thematic. While writing this chapter (in general the whole document), the author will consider the knowledge accumulated from several dedicated disciplines in the second semester, 4$^{th}$ year (Project Elaboration Methodology, etc.), and other disciplines that are relevant to the project theme.

Represents about 15\% of the paper.

Each reference must be cited within the document text, see example below (depending on the project theme, the presentation of a method/application can vary).


This section includes citations for conferences or workshop~\cite{BellucciLZ04}, journals~\cite{AntoniouSBDB07}, 
and books~\cite{russell1995artificial}. 

In paper~\cite{AntoniouSBDB07} the authors present a detection system for moving obstacles based on stereovision and ego motion estimation. 
The method is ... {\it discus the algorithms, data structures, functionality, specific aspects related to the project theme, etc.}... Discussion: {\it pros and cons}.

In chapter~\ref{ch:analysis} of~\cite{strunk}, the {\it similar-to-my-project-theme algorithm} is presented, with the following features ...

\chapter{Analysis and Theoretical Foundation}
\label{ch:analysis}

Together with the next chapter takes about 60\% of the whole paper

The purpose of this chapter is to explain the operating principles of the implemented application.
Here you write about your solution from a theory standpoint - i.e. you explain it and you demonstrate its theoretical properties/value, e.g.:
\begin{itemize}
 \item used or proposed algorithms
 \item used protocols
 \item abstract models
 \item logic explanations/arguments concerning the chosen solution
 \item logic and functional structure of the application, etc.
\end{itemize}

{\color{red} YOU DO NOT write about implementation.

YOU DO NOT copy/paste info on technologies from various sources and others alike, which do not pertain to your project.

\chapter{Detailed Design and Implementation}
The following chapter presents the architecture, components and implementation particularities of the ATHENA application.

\section{Python and Django}
The choice of Python as main programming language for this application, alongside the choice of Django as a framework, were based on the industry's long-time endorsement of these technologies. According to the TIOBE programming language index, Python ranks as the 6th most popular programming language, the index being calculated according to the number of engineers world-wide, courses and third-party vendors concerned with this programming language \cite{tiobeindex}. Its higher ranked competitors are Java and the C family (C, C++ and C\#), which are not as well diversified in the field of research and string processing as Python.

\subsubsection{Python for scientists}
Besides its prevalence in the web application realm, Python is also one of the preferred languages for research, as argued in \cite{millman2011python}, with a plethora of scientific-oriented third-part libraries including NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib. String processing is also generally considered faster and more cohesive than in other programming languages.

\subsubsection{Python libraries}
One of the main libraries used here is Django, arguably the best known Python web framework. Django was chosen in the detriment of others such as Flask and CherryPy, due to its active and dynamic open source community, its good documentation resources, high number of compatible third party libraries and generally available support with installation, development and running.

For the purpose of this application, a number of libraries were installed via \texttt{pip}, the package manager preferred by Python applications. The entire application was build using \texttt{virtualenv}, a virtual environment creator that helps Python developers manage different Python versions in different environments, to avoid unnecessary creation of virtual machines. Running the command \texttt{pip freeze} inside the activated virtual environment we get the list of installed third party libraries:

\lstset{basicstyle=\scriptsize}
\begin{lstlisting}
amqp==1.4.9
anyjson==0.3.3
beautifulsoup4==4.4.1
billiard==3.3.0.23
cassandra-driver==3.4.1
celery==3.1.18
cssselect==0.9.1
cycler==0.10.0
DistributedLock==1.2
Django==1.8.13
django-annoying==0.9.0
django-m2m-history==0.3.5
django-oauth-tokens==0.6.3
django-picklefield==0.3.2
django-taggit==0.19.1
futures==3.0.5
kombu==3.0.35
lxml==3.6.0
nltk==3.2.1
numpy==1.11.0
oauthlib==1.1.1
pandas==0.18.1
pyparsing==2.1.4
pyquery==1.2.13
python-dateutil==2.5.3
python-memcached==1.58
pytz==2016.4
redis==2.10.3
requests==2.10.0
requests-oauthlib==0.6.1
scikit-learn==0.17.1
scipy==0.17.1
simplejson==3.8.2
six==1.10.0
sklearn==0.0
tweepy==3.5.0
\end{lstlisting}

The advantage of using the \texttt{pip} package manager is that upon installing either library, its dependencies are installed as well. Throughout this thesis I will refer to the list of installed libraries when explaining the choice and particular implementation where each library is used. For now, please note the Django 1.8 installation, which is the current long-term release, chosen for its stability and support.

\section{Storage with Cassandra}
The Cassandra NoSQL database was chosen for this project's non-relational database requirement, due to its large flexibility and scalability to more clusters when the need arises.

A Cassandra server was installed locally and needs to be up for all queries run from the aplication. The Python library \texttt{cassandra-driver} allows for easy connection to Cassandra clusters and execution of queries, similarly to SQL ones. Empyrical debugging is easy via the \texttt{cqlsh} command line utility, which acts like a Cassandra interactive console. Figure \ref{fig:cqlsh} presents a demo of these functionalities, including starting up the console, connecting to a cluster and submitting a query.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{img/cqlsh.png}
    \caption{Demo of the cqlsh utility}
    \label{fig:cqlsh}
\end{figure}

The same functionality can be mirrored in Python using the following set of instructions:

\lstset{basicstyle=\scriptsize}
\begin{lstlisting}
from cassandra.cluster import Cluster

cluster = Cluster()
session = cluster.connect('demo')

 harvests = session.execute(
    """
    select * from tweets limit 2
    """
)
\end{lstlisting}

with the result being a generator which can be further consumed by the application. This means that it is easy to perform queries programatically, without much overhead, by employing the usage of this driver.

Cassandra queries are used throughout the application, both in synchronous and asynchronous application steps. Its speedy retrieval and updating of records is not a bottleneck, as API rate limits are.

\chapter{User's manual}

In the installation description section your should detail the hardware and software resources needed for installing and running the application, and a step by step description of how your application can be deployed/installed. An administrator should be able to perform the installation/deployment based on your instructions.

In the user manual section you describe how to use the application from the point of view of a user with no inside technical information; this should be done with screen shots and a stepwize explanation of the interaction. Based on user's manual, a person should be able to use your product.
